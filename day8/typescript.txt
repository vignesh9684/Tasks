The class Movie is stated below. An instance of class Movie represents a film. This class has the following three properties:

title, which is a String representing the title of the movie
studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie
rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie (i.e. PG­13, R, etc)

 class Movie {
 String title;
 String studio;
 String rating;
 // your code goes here
}

a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values.

class Movie(String t, String s, String r) {
 title = t;
studio = s;
 rating = r;
}

b) The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.

constructor (String t, String s) {
 title = t;
 studio = s;
 rating = “PG”;
}

c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument, and returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full of Movie instances. The returned array need not be full.

class Movie[] getPG(Movie[] mov) {
 Movie[] pgMov = new Movie[mov.length];
 int newArrayIndex = 0;
 for (int i = 0; i < mov.length; i++) {
 if (mov[i].rating.equals(“PG”)) {
 pgMov[newArrayIndex] = mov[i];
 newArrayIndex++;
 }
 }
 return pgMov;
}

d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”

class Movie mov = new Movie(“Casino Royale”,”Eon
 Productions”,”PG-13”);
